### OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)
```
Example:

Objective: Improve user engagement

Key Results:
1. Increase daily active users from 10K to 15K

3. Increase feature adoption from 30% to 60%

How to implement:
- Set quarterly OKRs
- Share with team
- Track progress weekly/monthly
- Adjust as needed
- Review and retrospective at end of quarter
```

### Metrics That Matter
- **Adoption**: % of users using feature
- **Retention**: % of users returning
- **Engagement**: Activity level
- **Satisfaction**: NPS, CSAT
- **Business**: Revenue, ARR, churn

## Decision Making

### Framework for Technical Decisions
```
1. Define the problem clearly

✓ Quick tactical fixes
✓ Day-to-day work prioritization
```

## Organizational Leadership

### Company Culture
- **Values**: What we believe
- **Mission**: Why we exist
- **Vision**: Where we're going
- **Norms**: How we work together

### Scaling Engineering
```
Early Stage (1-5 people):
- Individual coding
- Direct communication
- Ad-hoc processes

Growth Stage (5-20 people):
- Specialization emerging
- Team leads introduced
- Processes formalized

Scale Stage (20-100 people):
- Multiple teams
- Team leads → Managers
- Cross-team coordination

Enterprise (100+ people):
- Directors and VPs
- Complex org structure
- Formal processes and policies
```

### Retention
Key factors:
- Career growth opportunities
- Competitive compensation
- Work-life balance
- Challenging problems
- Team and culture
- Impact and purpose
- Autonomy and trust

## Communication Skills

### Presentation Skills
```
Structure:
1. Hook (Why should they care?)
2. Problem (What's the challenge?)
3. Solution (How do we solve it?)
4. Impact (What's the benefit?)
5. Call to action (What's next?)
```

### Writing for Leaders
```
Executive Summary Framework:
- Situation: Current state
- Complication: Problem/challenge
- Resolution: Solution proposed
- Impact: Expected outcomes
- Action: What we need
```

### Feedback Skills
```
Good Feedback:
- Specific (not vague)
- Timely (soon after event)
- Actionable (clear steps to improve)
- Balanced (acknowledge strengths too)
- Private (when critical)

Example:
"In the meeting today, when you interrupted Sarah, it seemed dismissive of her ideas.
I noticed she didn't contribute much after that. Going forward, try waiting for her
to finish before responding. Your technical insights are valuable when combined with
listening to others."
```
